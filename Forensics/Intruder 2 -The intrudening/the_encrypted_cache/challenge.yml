description: "Who needs persistence when you have clueless employees. gaining access to the local network yet again.

This time the attacker did more than just leave a message.

When the employee clicked a link on what he thought was an Omnitrix giveaway site, he installed a harmless looking pdf file and opened it, granting the attacker acccess to the machine.

A carefully placed script he ran allowed him to download malicious SUS files into the victim machine, allowing him to capture keystrokes and whatnot.

Then he injected the malicious files into legitimate softwares compromising their use and ensure that they keep running.

The Employee responsible was executed.

Our Forensics team managed to stop the attack and gather information on the system but even they couldn't uncover the vastness of the damage done, maybe you can.

Find out 

Through which port did the attacker maintain remote access?
Which malicious file, disguised as a PDF, did the employee download?
Which reverse_tcp file communicated with the attacker?
Which shell script did the attacker use to transfer malicious libraries?
Which sneaky DLL file did the attacker drop among Zoom files?
What is the parent PID of the process that created the file where the keystrokes were saved?
Which legitimate process was used to run the keylogger?
A file in the same directory as the keylogger was used to inject malicious DLLs into processes, what is its full path?

Note: write all filenames and process names with the extension

flag format: CHC{port_fileName_revTCPname_scriptName_dllName_PID_processName_Path}

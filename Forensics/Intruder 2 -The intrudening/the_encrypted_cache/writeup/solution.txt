goto network tab and we can see 2 conenctions to internal network IPs, 192.168.64.142 - check its port number

in file changes filter we see an exe with PDF icon - its fullname

in networksork tab again - filter the ip found earlier 192.168.64.142 and see which process uses it

follow the time stamps and see which files did the pdf drop among them is a powershell script.

filter "path contains Zoom" there u can see the file in the beginning, name makes it obvious.

once the keystroke file is found check when it was created and see the Parent PID

find the location of the logger then apply filter for that path and u will find the injector file, check its full path.

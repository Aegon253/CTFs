description: "A Rogue Developer in our society left and decided to create his own society, he called it KHK, whatever that stands for.

The brilliant hackers in our society managed to track him down and get a hold of his laptop.

apparently he stole a flag from us and hid its parts among his files.

but we could only find a CTF poster on his laptop.

Can you find the flag?.

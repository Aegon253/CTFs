description: "A scammer stole some money from Mr.FANG, we managed to track down the scammer (levi) and get an image of his PC, but it only has a few files, 1.some victim files, 2. a banking app and another file.
logon to the scammers device to send the money back to Mr.FANG. We already have his account Name (FANG). The scammer mustve been a close freind because Mr.FANG had this to say about him.\n 

"Tum hi se wabasta he ye umeed ay bashar e bad-ghumaan
Agar Tum hi bhool jao to kider jaynge hum 
Tum sath ho chal rhe hain zindagi ki raaho pr 
Aik tum hi hath chordo to kider jaynge hum"
